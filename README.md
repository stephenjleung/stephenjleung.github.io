baby name website

This is an HTML/CSS/Javascript project I started with a focus on baby names.
I have given myself the rule that I cannot use Javascript frameworks, such as Jquery or React.
This site utilizes a free baby name API, "http://www.behindthename.com/api/",
and popular-name data from the US Census:  "https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html".
